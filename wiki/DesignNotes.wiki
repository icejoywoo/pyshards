#summary Pyshards design notes

=== Shard (Physical Shard) ===

Hold the following truths to be self evident.

  * Remember: a Shard is a database; each shard typically resides on a different host
  * Each Shard shall contain an identical schema
  * Object graphs may not span shards
    * Hierarchical, normalized schema is fine, but children may not refer to parents living in another shard or visa-versa.

=== Shard Key ===

Imagine that you've created an auction site.  Users that want to create their own auctions do so by first registering with your system, providing a unique piece of identifying information.  This might be a system wide user name or the user's password.  Chances are, being a savvy web site developer, that you will keep a token of some type that represents this unique identifier in a web server session, and you will pass it back and forth to the client.  Assuming that you've chosen a nice hashable identifier, like a string, you now have a good candidate for the shard key.

The shard key is a unique identifier that you will provide to a shard cursor any time you want to read, write or delete information pertaining to a particular user.
